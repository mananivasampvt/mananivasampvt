# EmailJS Integration Fix - EMI Calculator

## Problem
The "Email EMI Summary" feature was failing because the EmailJS configuration was not properly set up. The code was using hardcoded placeholder values instead of actual EmailJS credentials.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated EmailJS Configuration**: 
   - Set up proper EmailJS credentials in `/src/config/emailjs-config.ts`
   - PUBLIC_KEY: `UJFEGLg5cPdJxgAT1`
   - SERVICE_ID: `service_6p4xblf`
   - TEMPLATE_ID: `template_z8h2vwg`

2. **Fixed EMI Calculator Implementation**:
   - Added import for `EMAILJS_CONFIG` from the config file
   - Updated `isEmailJSConfigured()` function to use the config values
   - Modified `sendEmailSummary()` function to use the actual credentials

## Files Modified
1. `/src/config/emailjs-config.ts` - Updated with actual EmailJS credentials
2. `/src/pages/EMICalculator.tsx` - Fixed imports and configuration usage

## How It Works Now
1. When user clicks "Email EMI Summary", the system checks if EmailJS is configured
2. If configured (which it now is), it uses EmailJS to send the email directly
3. If not configured, it falls back to opening the user's email client
4. The email includes all EMI calculation details, eligibility information, and prepayment impact

## Testing
- The email feature should now work properly
- Users need to be logged in to use the feature
- The email will be sent to the logged-in user's email address automatically
- Loading spinner and toast notifications provide user feedback

## Next Steps
- Test the email functionality by:
  1. Logging in to the application
  2. Calculating an EMI
  3. Clicking "Email EMI Summary"
  4. Verifying the email is received

The EmailJS integration is now properly configured and should work without the "failed to send" error.
