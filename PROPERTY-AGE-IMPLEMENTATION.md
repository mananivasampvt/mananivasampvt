## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Form Validation & UX
- **Client-side validation**: Only accepts numbers 0-200
- **Real-time feedback**: Toast notifications for invalid inputs
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and ARIA compliance
- **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive input design
- **Graceful handling**: Empty values are allowed (backward compatibility)

### ✅ Data Flow & Backend Handling
- **Form submission**: Property age is properly captured and stored
- **Database integration**: Field is saved to Firestore with type conversion
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing properties without age field work normally
- **API consistency**: Field flows through all data layers correctly

### ✅ Frontend Display Integration
- **Property Overview**: Attractive card display with Calendar icon
- **Property Details**: Desktop sidebar integration
- **Property Cards**: Subtle badge display
- **Consistent styling**: Indigo theme across all displays
- **Smart text formatting**: "New Construction" vs "X Years Old"

### ✅ Performance & Security
- **Input sanitization**: Numbers only, proper range validation  
- **Lightweight UI**: Minimal impact on page load times
- **Optimized queries**: No additional database overhead
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript integration

## Design Decisions

### UI/UX Decisions
1. **Color Theme**: Used indigo for property age to distinguish from other property attributes
2. **Display Logic**: Show "New Construction" for 0 years, "X Year(s) Old" for others
3. **Placement**: Added to key metrics section in PropertyOverview for visibility
4. **Validation**: Real-time feedback to prevent user frustration
5. **Optional Field**: Made field optional to maintain backward compatibility

### Technical Decisions
1. **Data Type**: Stored as number in database for proper sorting/filtering potential
2. **Validation Range**: 0-200 years as reasonable bounds for real estate
3. **Interface Updates**: Added to all relevant TypeScript interfaces
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when field is not present
5. **Form Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing form flow
